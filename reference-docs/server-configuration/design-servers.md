# Design servers

Any livingdocs server can act as design server. 

## Configure a design server 

In the configuration of the livingdocs server, you can point `designsApi:host` to any livingdocs server
instance, even a local installation.

```coffee
module.exports =
  designsApi:
    host: 'http://localhost:9090'
```

For simple evaluations you can use the server of our service at `https://api.livingdocs.io`. 
When customizing livingdocs, you might want to configure your own.

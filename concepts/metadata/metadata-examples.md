# Example 1: Full Example on how to Introduce a Metadata Field with a Standard Metadata Plugin

Say we want to create a new metadata field "catchline" for articles of your default web channel. The catchline should be a simple text input on the publish panel that journalists can edit.

To find out more about metadata you can read the documentation about metadata on the [server](../../core/livingdocs-server/metadata.md) and the [editor](../../core/livingdocs-editor/metadata.md).

## Server

(Note: we assume the use of the [Livingdocs server boilerplate](https://github.com/upfrontIO/livingdocs-server-boilerplate) here)

You will first need to configure this in your server.

**Configuration Example with a Default Plugin**
```js
metadata: {
  // Name of the metadata field
  catchline: {
    // Define the plugin for the catchline
    // 'li-text' is the name defined in /plugins/metadata/li-text
    plugin: 'li-text'
  }
}
```

1. A standard plugin is stored in `plugins/metadata` and will automatically be loaded on the downstream and is always ready for usage. In our example we use `li-text`.
2. Open the respective configuration file, in our case `conf/channels/web/article/all.coffee` and add the catchline config from the example to the metadata object into `all.coffee`.
3. Open your elastic search metadata mapping (typically in `search/custom-mappings/metadata.json`) and add an entry as follows (the key `properties` probably already exists):
```json
{
  "properties": {
    "catchline": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
}
```
4. Reset your document elastic search index by running `grunt search-index:document:reset`

## Editor

After you've setup your new metadata field you can now use it in the editor. Open the respective configuration file, `all.coffee` if you want to have it in all environments, and add a configuration as follows:
```coffee
metadata:
    article: [
      name: 'catchline'
      form: 'li-meta-text-form'
      config:
        service: 'defaultText'
    ]
```

This will render a text-input field to the publish screen of articles where users can type in the value for the "catchline" which is automatically saved to the server.


# Example 2: Activate and Use a Custom Plugin

If you want to define and use a custom plugin, you have to do the following steps on the server:

- Define the custom plugin folder in the environment config (`conf/environments/all.coffee`).

```js
metadataPlugins: { path.resolve('./plugins/metadata') }
```

* Add a new custom plugin to './plugins/metadata/customername-pluginname.js'

```js
module.exports = {
  name: 'customername-pluginname',
  schema: {
    type: 'string'
  }
}
```

* Activate the custom plugin in the channel config

```js
metadata: {
  myNewMetadataField: {
    plugin: 'customername-pluginname'
  }
}
```
